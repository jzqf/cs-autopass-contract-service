	<!-- Container-managed JNDI Datasource:
	
	name:		Must match the name of a resource made available to the 
				application by a <resource-ref> element in web.xml.
				
	type:		Must match the type of a resource made available to the 
				application by a <resource-ref> element in web.xml.
	
	maxActive:	The maximum number of active connections that can be allocated 
				from this pool at the same time, or negative for no limit.

	maxIdle:	The maximum number of connections that can remain idle in the 
				pool, without extra ones being released, or negative for no 
				limit.  See also the DBCP documentation on this and the 
				minEvictableIdleTimeMillis configuration parameter.
				
	maxWait:	The maximum number of milliseconds that the pool will wait (when
				there are no available connections) for a connection to be 
				returned before throwing an exception, or -1 to wait 
				indefinitely.  This should probably be set to be at least as
				long as the maximum amount of time that garbage collection will
				take in the container (e.g., Tomcat). 10 seconds is probably a 
				reasonable choice.

	username:	Sybase user name for database connections
	
	password:	Sybase password for database connections

	driverClassName:	The fully qualified Java class name of the JDBC driver
						to be used.

	url:		The JDBC connection url for connecting to the Sybase AutoPASS
				database.
